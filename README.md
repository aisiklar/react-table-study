# Title

a work / study on react-tables.

## Teck Stack:

- next.js (react.js)
- typescript
- tailwind css
- to be added in case

## Scope

I am studying on a simple yet effective way of tabulating data.
May try on different methods. Therefore may add new ones overtime.

### Method-1

- Here I am tabulating the data with HTML elements (< table > etc.) and passing all the data myself. No external lib is used.
- all logic and UI is mine.
- may convert this to an NPM library if I like the results and performance.
